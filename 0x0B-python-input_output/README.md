# Python Input - Output
In this project I learnt how to perform python input and output operations.

## Tasks
### 0. Read file
Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:
* Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
* You must use the '_with_ statement
* You don't need to manage _file permission or file doesn't exist_ exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module


|file                  |prototype                 |test files                                                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|0-read_file.py        | def read_file(filename=""|[0-main.py](./tests/0-main.py)[my_file_0.txt](./tests/my_file_0.txt)|

### Usage:
Make sure the 0-main.py file is in the same directory as the 0-read_file.py.

$ ./main.py
