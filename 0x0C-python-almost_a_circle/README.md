# Python-Almost a circle

This project helps me to get ready for the AirBnB project which is a big part of the Higher level curriculum.

In this project, I get to review everything about python:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Setter/Getter
* Static method
* Class method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Readdd/Write file

Including:
- _*args_ and _**kwargs_
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS usin python3(version 3.8.5)
* All files should end with  new line
* The first line of all the files should be exactly _#!/usr/bin/python3_
* The code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.)
* All the files must be executable
* All the modules should be documented
* All the classes shoud be documented
* All functions(inside and outside a class)0 should be documented

## Unit Testing
This is a software testing method by which individual units of source code together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures are tested to determine if they are fit for use. in this project the python buitin *unittest module* was used as a unit testing framework.
* The test files can be tested using this command: _python3 -m unitest tests/test_models/test_base.py_
* All tests can be executed by using this command: _python3 -m unittest discover tests_
